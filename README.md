# The Book Swap
Welcome to the Book Swap! An application that allows users to connect with other book lovers to find and swap books. With Book Swap, users can search for a specific book they are looking for, or browse through a list of books available online. Once they find a book they are interested in, they can request to swap with the owner of the book. This is a great way for people to discover new books and expand their reading collection without having to spend any money. Plus, it helps reduce waste by giving used books a new home.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you would like to contribute, please fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature. Once you have made your changes, submit a pull request and we will review your changes.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
